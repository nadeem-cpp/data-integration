<h1><i>Integrating data from differnt sources into a single warehouse AWS Redshift</i></h1>
<br>
<h1 align="center">In Progess</h1>
<h3><b>summary</b></h3>
<br>
user can upload data from differnt sources in differnt formats like csv excel etc
<br> after that system will ask user about the differnt colums that have same values but differ by their column name due to 
differnt sources <br> after that sys will process on them and save them on redshif or let the user donwload it for local storage.
<br> it will also have a messagin bot that will directly send msgs from client to technical person on thier whatsapp and thier replay will be displayed on app's UI
<br> the messaging interface will require google authentication for user authentication.
<h1>Data Integration and Processing System</h1>

<p>This system allows users to seamlessly upload data from different sources in various formats, such as CSV and Excel. The data integration process begins with the system prompting users to identify columns that contain similar values but have different names due to varying sources. Once identified, the system proceeds to process and store the integrated data in Redshift, a powerful data warehousing solution, or allows users to download it for local storage.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Upload:</strong> Users can upload data from different sources, including CSV and Excel files, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of formats.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Column Matching:</strong> The system intelligently prompts users to match columns with similar values but different names from various sources. This step streamlines the data integration process and ensures accuracy.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The system performs advanced processing and transformation on the integrated data to derive valuable insights. Users can define specific rules and transformations to be applied during this step.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Storage Options:</strong> Integrated data can be seamlessly stored in Redshift, a high-performance data warehousing solution, which enables efficient querying and analysis. Alternatively, users can choose to download the integrated data for local storage or further processing.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Messaging Bot:</strong> The system includes a messaging interface that facilitates direct communication between clients and technical personnel via WhatsApp. Clients can send messages through the app's user interface, and the responses from technical personnel are displayed in real-time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Google Authentication:</strong> To ensure secure user authentication, the messaging interface requires users to authenticate via Google. This adds an extra layer of protection to prevent unauthorized access to the messaging feature.</li>
</ol>

<p>By leveraging this data integration and processing system, users can effortlessly integrate and process data from multiple sources, enabling them to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions. The intuitive user interface and powerful features make it a reliable and efficient solution for managing complex data integration tasks.</p>
